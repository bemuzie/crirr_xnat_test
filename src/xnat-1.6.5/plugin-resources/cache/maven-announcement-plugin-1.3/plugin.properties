# Properties for the Announcement plugin
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Version for which to create a release note. If not defined, it 
# defaults to ${pom.currentVersion}.
# For example:
# maven.announcement.version = ${pom.currentVersion}

# Distribution location. For now, this property does not exist in the
# POM (there's only a distributionSite and distributionDirectory which
# doesn't map to anything for the web). We'll need to remove this
# property once it makes it into the POM. 
# If not defined, it defaults to "${maven.repo.remote}/${pom.groupId}/plugins"
# For example:
# maven.announcement.distributionUrl = http//www.mysite.com/dist

# Stylesheet to use to generate the text announcement
maven.announcement.stylesheet.path = ${plugin.resources}/announcement.jsl

# Encoding to be used to generate the file
maven.announcement.encoding = UTF-8

# IP address or name of the SMTP server used to send an announcement email
# maven.announcement.mail.server = 

# IP address or name of the host used to log on the SMTP server
maven.announcement.mail.client = localhost

# From address to use when sending an announcement email. If not defined, 
# the first email address found in the POM will be used.
# maven.announcement.mail.from =

# Comma-separated list of addresses to use when sending an announcement email.
# maven.announcement.mail.to =

# Mail subject to use when sending an announcement email.
maven.announcement.mail.subject = [ANN] ${pom.name} %VERSION% released
